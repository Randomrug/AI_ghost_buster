# AI_ghost_buster
Your spectral study sidekick that busts distractions and boosts productivity with AI-powered focus tools.  Features a playful ghost companion that reacts to your browsing, offers smart search analysis, and transforms into an interactive pet.  Three modes: Study (focus assistant), Relax (stress relief), and Play (ghost interactions).

HOW TO USE???

Download the zip and extract all the files.
Open the background.js file â€” youâ€™ll find two spots (around line 25 and 95) where you need to paste your API key.
To get it, go to openrouter.ai, search for any free model (I used DeepSeek v3 base and Mistral), scroll down, click "Create API Key", name it, and copy it (you wonâ€™t see it again). Paste that key in both places.

Then open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/, turn on Developer Mode (top-right), click Load unpacked, and select the folder you just extracted. Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ll see Boo appear and start reacting to your browsing â€” study stuff gets cheers, distractions get ghost-roasts ðŸ‘»ðŸ’€


you are never feeling lonely again... ghostbuster is here to haunt u buddyyyyyyyyy.
